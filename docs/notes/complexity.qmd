# Code Complexity


Complex codebases are harder to manage, maintain, and debug.

Developers strive to reduce both **time complexity** (the number of operations required to perform a task) and **space complexity** (the amount of memory required to perform a task).

This not only improves runtime performance but also enhances the system's ability to scale efficiently.

## Complexity Assessment Tools

Tools like the [Code Climate](./code-climate.qmd) platform can perform automated assessments of code complexity, helping you identify opportunities to refactor.
