# Custom Classes

A **Class** is a representation of one or more [objects](object-oriented-programming.qmd) which share the same or similar properties. Each class is like its own custom data type with attributes, methods, and properties defined by the developer.


## Definition

In Python, we define a class using the `class` keyword, followed by the name of the class in titlecase. The class definition requires a specific function called `__init__` to initialize, or create a new member of the object class. A class definition may contain many other methods and properties as well.

Here is a simple example of a custom class definition:

```{python}
class Polo():
    def __init__(self, color, size, price=99.00, style=None):
        self.color = color
        self.size = size
        self.price = price
        self.style = style

    def fold(self):
        print("FOLDING THE " + self.color.upper() + " POLO!")

    def transfer_to(self, store_name):
        print(f"SHIPPING THE {self.color.upper()} POLO TO STORE: '{store_name.upper()}'")

```

Here we see some example instance methods called `fold` and `transfer_to`. All instance methods within a class must take `self` as their first required parameter. This is a reference to the instance itself.

## Initialization

After defining an object class, we can create any number of new members, or "instances", of that object class.

Although multiple instances can have different values, the attributes and behaviors are shared across all instances.

Here are some initialization and usage examples for the `Polo` class:

```{python}
polo_1 = Polo(color="Blue", size="Large", price=4.99)
print(type(polo_1))

polo_2 = Polo(color="Yellow", size="Small")
print(type(polo_2))

polo_3 = Polo(color="Red", size="Large", price=65.00, style="Slim")
print(type(polo_3))
```

Attributes:

```{python}
print(polo_1.color, polo_1.price)
print(polo_2.color, polo_2.price)
print(polo_3.color, polo_3.price)
```

Methods:

```{python}
polo_1.fold()
polo_2.fold()
polo_3.fold()
```

```{python}
polo_1.transfer_to("Washington, DC")
polo_2.transfer_to("New York, NY")
polo_3.transfer_to("Boston, MA")
```

## Decorators and Special Methods

We can use a handful of ["special methods"](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names) and method [decorators](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-decorator) to supercharge our classes. Special methods are sometimes known as "dunder methods" because they start and end with double underscores. Decorators are defined with preceding `@` character.

The class definition below shows an example of using the `__repr__` special method, or "representation" function, which determines how the instance should be displayed when printed. It also implements the `__iter__` method, which determines what is returned when the item is converted to a dictionary.

Common decorators include:

  + `@property`: when you want to invoke the method as a noun, without trailing parentheses
  + `@classmethod`: when you want to invoke the method on the class itself, instead of on an instance of that class
  + `@staticmethod`: when the method doesn't need any information about the instance (i.e. no references to `self`)

This class uses the `@property` decorator, which allows us to invoke a given method without trailing parentheses (e.g. `team.full_name` instead of `team.full_name()`). This is basically a stylistic choice on our part, enabling us to use properties to represent nouns, and methods to represent verbs.

```{python}
class Team():
    def __init__(self, city, name):
        self.city = city
        self.name = name

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<Team '{self.name}'>"

    def __iter__(self):
        yield "city", self.city
        yield "name", self.name

    @property
    def full_name(self):
        return self.city + " " + self.name

    def advertise(self):
        print("COME TO", self.city.upper(), "TO SEE OUR GAMES!")

```

Here are some initialization and usage examples for the `Team` class:

```{python}
team1 = Team(city="Seattle", name="Storm")
team2 = Team(city="Connecticut", name="Sun")

print(type(team1))
print(type(team2))
```

Special methods:

```{python}
print(team1)
print(dict(team1))

print(team2)
print(dict(team2))
```

Properties:

```{python}
print(team1.full_name)
print(team2.full_name)
```

Normal methods:

```{python}
team1.advertise()
team2.advertise()
```
